# PyGame-Panoramic
Allows a Panoramic view (using PyGame for the GUI, and some maths). Will retain objects placed on certain panoramic panels independent of where they are viewed.

If the print spam gets annoying, remove this line:
```
print(f"{r}, {panorama_x}, {panorama_x_local} -- {panorama_list_extra}")
```

And here are some values you can adjust in the code:
```
fps = 60
```
```
width, height = 1280, 720
```
```
lookspeed = 3000
```

And the code to adjust if you want to move the stickman:
```
(panora_part[1] + 500, 50))
```
_**Requires Python 3.13. Probably works on some older versions.**_
